00:00:03.532 --> 00:00:05.350
Hello and welcome.

2
00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:08.910
Today we are very fortunate to have
Professor Caroline Wang to speak

3
00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:13.730
to us today about effective and
persuasive business speaking.

4
00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:15.020
Good afternoon, Professor.

5
00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:17.780
Thank you for taking the time
to talk to us students today.

6
00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:21.010
I'd like to start off with a question.

7
00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:24.304
What are the measures of success
to being an effective and

8
00:00:24.304 --> 00:00:26.166
persuasive business speaker?

9
00:00:26.166 --> 00:00:27.507
>> Okay, thank you.

10
00:00:27.507 --> 00:00:29.490
It's a very important question.

11
00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:35.430
Unless we know what the measure of
success are, it's hard to improve.

12
00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:39.370
So, I would divide into two
parts to answer that question.

13
00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:45.950
To me, effective and
good business communication,

14
00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:49.910
we must learn to focus on two
parts to continue to improve.

15
00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:54.280
The first part is content, and
the second part is delivery.

16
00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:56.100
So in terms of content,

17
00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:01.460
I will use two adjective to describe
a really good, effective and

18
00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:07.540
persuasive business communication that
is substantial and consequential.

19
00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:10.217
Substantial means that
there must be substance,

20
00:01:10.217 --> 00:01:13.794
because without substance we
don't really need to communicate.

21
00:01:13.794 --> 00:01:18.726
So there must be substance,
but the substance always need

22
00:01:18.726 --> 00:01:23.569
to be delivered in a way that
is credible to the audience.

23
00:01:23.569 --> 00:01:28.406
That means we have to substantiate any
claims that we make in the business

24
00:01:28.406 --> 00:01:30.450
communication.

25
00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:36.080
For example if we say that
this product is wonderful

26
00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:40.550
because it can do the following things.

27
00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:43.437
Then we have to have evidence
to support the claim.

28
00:01:43.437 --> 00:01:48.658
Or if we say the sales leader
tell the sales team that we

29
00:01:48.658 --> 00:01:53.662
are going to achieve
200% of target this year.

30
00:01:53.662 --> 00:01:58.670
Then, that claim must be
substantiated with evidence.

31
00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:59.240
For example,

32
00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:04.060
we have better product, or we have larger
territories, to cover, and so forth.

33
00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:06.930
Otherwise, the content is not credible.

34
00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:09.690
So the first part, the content,
must be substantial.

35
00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:14.858
The second part about
content is consequential.

36
00:02:14.858 --> 00:02:18.380
That means if we want
the audience to do something

37
00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:23.300
that the end of our communication
then we must deliver a consequential

38
00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:26.620
communication versus
an inconsequential communication.

39
00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:29.270
That means they won't
do anything at the end.

40
00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:32.320
Even they like the speech,
but no action will be taken.

41
00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:34.250
That would be inconsequential.

42
00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:41.670
So consequential must be delivered in
a way that we will show the audience

43
00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:47.570
the consequences of taking the action or
not taking the action.

44
00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:52.500
A very simple example would be
we could say attitude is so

45
00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:57.057
important, which is easily understandable.

46
00:02:57.057 --> 00:03:03.791
However it's more consequential if
we say attitude determines altitude.

47
00:03:03.791 --> 00:03:08.860
That means good attitude will
bring us higher in our life.

48
00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:13.260
And when we have a bad attitude,
it bring us down.

49
00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:18.420
So that is more consequential than
just saying something is important.

50
00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:22.794
If we can say something is important
because it brings certain consequences.

51
00:03:22.794 --> 00:03:24.748
So that's what I call consequential.

52
00:03:24.748 --> 00:03:28.638
So I think a good,
effective business communication,

53
00:03:28.638 --> 00:03:32.540
the content must be substantial,
and consequential.

54
00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:35.410
Now it comes to the delivery.

55
00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:40.733
That it should be efficient and
effective, because everyone's busy.

56
00:03:40.733 --> 00:03:43.193
The speaker is busy,
the audience are busy, and

57
00:03:43.193 --> 00:03:45.595
therefore we should not
waste people's time.

58
00:03:45.595 --> 00:03:49.792
Get to the point efficiently,
use the least amount of time, and

59
00:03:49.792 --> 00:03:54.941
least number of iteration to achieve
the business communication objective.

60
00:03:54.941 --> 00:04:01.555
However, there are times the content of
our communication may trigger doubts,

61
00:04:01.555 --> 00:04:07.900
controversy, or even negative emotion
in the audience heart or mind.

62
00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:11.040
Then instead of delivering the message so

63
00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:16.030
efficiently, get to the point quickly,
we must really consider

64
00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:20.670
the effect our communication will
create in the audience mind.

65
00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:25.470
And be willing to spend more times, and

66
00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:30.510
even though it may sound inefficient
to spend more time to take the audience

67
00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:36.610
through the process, then weâ€™re led to
the outcome that we want to achieve.

68
00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:40.902
So that we create a better effect,
and for better acceptance.

69
00:04:40.902 --> 00:04:46.123
For example if we're announcing a company
restructuring, instead of delivering

70
00:04:46.123 --> 00:04:51.058
that outcome efficiently, say I'm here
to announce a company restructure.

71
00:04:51.058 --> 00:04:56.998
I need to take some time to explain
the process that led to the outcome,

72
00:04:56.998 --> 00:05:01.329
so that the audience are more
mentally prepared and

73
00:05:01.329 --> 00:05:08.093
they understand the process better, and
they can receive the outcome better.

74
00:05:08.093 --> 00:05:13.817
So I would say the delivery must
be both efficient and effective.

75
00:05:13.817 --> 00:05:18.880
So in summary, a persuasive and
effective business communication

76
00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:23.066
needs to take care of both the content and
the delivery.

77
00:05:23.066 --> 00:05:27.433
And content should be substantial and
consequential, and

78
00:05:27.433 --> 00:05:30.935
delivery needs to be efficient and
effective.

79
00:05:30.935 --> 00:05:33.110
>> Okay, thank you very much, Professor.

80
00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:36.500
I have another question,
how do we improve?

81
00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:38.310
How do we become better?

82
00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:40.090
>> Okay, that's very important.

83
00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:42.430
Well, the improvement always
starts with our mind,

84
00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:46.090
not start with when we open our mouth.

85
00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:48.810
In fact, when we open our mouth,
it's a little too late.

86
00:05:48.810 --> 00:05:53.860
So, if we cannot think clearly in our own
mind, we can never deliver it clearly.

87
00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:56.090
So it start with our mind.

88
00:05:56.090 --> 00:06:00.438
Then how do we prepare,
is that start with our mind and

89
00:06:00.438 --> 00:06:06.330
answer three question in the shoes, or
in the perspective, of the audience.

90
00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:10.658
That is, what do I want the audience
to do after this communication?

91
00:06:10.658 --> 00:06:17.020
And then I can prepare, what should I say,
so that they remember what to do.

92
00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:20.740
And also they feel motivated to do it.

93
00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:26.910
So in order to be better,
always start with our own mind.

94
00:06:26.910 --> 00:06:32.570
Think clearly the answer to
the following three questions.

95
00:06:32.570 --> 00:06:39.830
Which is what do I want the audience
to remember, feel and do.

96
00:06:39.830 --> 00:06:43.580
And once we can think clearly in our mind

97
00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:47.410
then we can do a good preparation and
then we can do a good delivery.

98
00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:52.280
>> Thank you very much, Professor,
for taking the time again.

99
00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:57.340
I'm sure our students will find your
comments very helpful, very useful.

100
00:06:57.340 --> 00:06:58.930
>> Takes a lot of practices.

101
00:06:58.930 --> 00:07:00.360
>> Yes.
>> [LAUGH] Sound simple but

102
00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:01.120
not necessarily easy.

103
00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:02.967
>> Definitely.

104
00:07:02.967 --> 00:07:07.370
>> Okay so best wishes for continuous
improvement through lots of practices.
