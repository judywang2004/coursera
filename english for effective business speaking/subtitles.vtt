Hi, and welcome to our course,
English for Effective Business Speaking.

2
00:00:07.570 --> 00:00:08.980
I'm Sean McMinn.

3
00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:09.700
Delian Kin and

4
00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:14.990
I are extremely excited about you joining
us on our journey through this course.

5
00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:18.070
We have two main goals for you.

6
00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:22.610
One is to introduce to you and
help you improve your business

7
00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:28.180
communication skills, from job interviews
to business meetings to business pitches.

8
00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:34.990
And our second goal is to help you improve
your spoken English, and this includes

9
00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:41.200
vocabulary usage, pronunciation skills,
and the way that you deliver a message.

10
00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:43.190
So those are our two main goals.

11
00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:45.570
And we'll be doing this in many ways.

12
00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:48.570
Throughout the course, you'll be
introduced to different things such as

13
00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:52.860
lecture videos where we give you some
sort of input or recommendations.

14
00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:54.780
And this is followed by activities or

15
00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:59.150
quizzes that allow you to practice
what we're talking about.

16
00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:03.730
We really encourage you to engage
with others in this course.

17
00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:08.710
Sometimes we have found in courses
like this that a good thing to do

18
00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:10.280
is to get on social media.

19
00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:14.800
Use Skype, use Facebook,
use WeChat, meet other people,

20
00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:19.170
contact them, ask them if you want to
practice your spoken English.

21
00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.440
And we find that a lot of people do.

22
00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:26.510
So if you have that opportunity, contact
other people in this course, call them up,

23
00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:29.460
say hey, I want to practice my spoken
English for a couple of minutes.

24
00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:30.840
Do you want to talk to me?

25
00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.280
And you'd be surprised.

26
00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.650
Many people want to do the same thing.

27
00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:38.110
So this course is a great thing for
many reasons.

28
00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:41.200
One, we're going to introduce to you
content that we think is important,

29
00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:44.840
that will help you develop
your spoken English.

30
00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:48.050
And it's also a chance for you to
meet people from around the world and

31
00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:49.920
practice your spoken English.

32
00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:54.230
Okay, so the three of us are really
looking forward to working with you.

33
00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:57.770
Have a look at the rest of
the materials in this module

34
00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:02.170
that discuss what we expect from you,
such as the learning objectives and

35
00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:06.910
also different ways that you can
learn both vocabulary and languages.

36
00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:09.520
And also what to expect from
the rest of this course.

37
00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:12.032
All right, see you soon.
