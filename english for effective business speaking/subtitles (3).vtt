Hi and welcome to this video
on challenging English sounds.

2
00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:11.620
In this lecture we're going to take a look
at a pair of challenging English sounds.

3
00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:15.830
They are th as in they, d as in day.

4
00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:22.370
This is a common area of difficulty
in English pronunciation.

5
00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:25.930
Many speakers who mispronounce
these sounds do so

6
00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:28.430
because these sounds don't
occur in their language.

7
00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:34.347
In reality, this [SOUND] sound
involving the speaker's tongue and

8
00:00:34.347 --> 00:00:36.097
top teeth is quite rare.

9
00:00:36.097 --> 00:00:39.900
And many European and
Asian languages lack its equivalent.

10
00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:47.565
For example, in Chinese, Japanese, French,
and German, is an unknown sound so

11
00:00:47.565 --> 00:00:53.986
duh is often used as a substitute because
duh is articulated in a similar way.

12
00:00:53.986 --> 00:00:59.500
Both the th and the duh sounds

13
00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:04.880
are created with the speaker's tongue
being placed behind the top teeth, and

14
00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:10.000
both are voiced, which means we use our
voices to help pronounce the words.

15
00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:13.070
So, this confusion is understandable.

16
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.470
To pronounce the th sound,
you relax your jaw.

17
00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:23.730
Separate your upper and
lower teeth by a few millimeters and

18
00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:27.226
place the tip of your tongue
between your upper and lower teeth.

19
00:01:27.226 --> 00:01:33.420
The th sound is produced by pushing or

20
00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:37.580
letting air flow between your tongue and
teeth while using your vocal cords.

21
00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:41.960
Take a few moments to watch
this animation which will show

22
00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:43.486
you how to make the th sound.

23
00:01:43.486 --> 00:01:47.730
[SOUND] Okay, let's

24
00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:52.474
practice this sound by

25
00:01:52.474 --> 00:01:57.723
repeating these words.

26
00:01:57.723 --> 00:02:01.593
The, This, father,

27
00:02:01.593 --> 00:02:06.697
together, bathe, loathe.

28
00:02:06.697 --> 00:02:10.630
Now repeat the following phrases.

29
00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:12.560
This and that.

30
00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:14.620
These and those.

31
00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:18.680
Gather together with each other.

32
00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:21.945
That's a worthy cause.

33
00:02:25.543 --> 00:02:28.830
Right, let's focus on the duh sound.

34
00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:32.310
To pronounce the duh sound.

35
00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:35.770
You place your tongue slightly
different from the th sound.

36
00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:40.730
You have to feel your tongue pushing
against the area where your upper teeth

37
00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:43.120
and the roof of your mouth meet.

38
00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:44.610
You push quite hard so

39
00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:49.610
no air can get out of your mouth
while you vibrate your vocal cords.

40
00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:51.466
This build pressure in your mouth.

41
00:02:51.466 --> 00:02:56.510
The sound duh is made by
suddenly releasing your tongue so

42
00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:59.670
that it touches your lower
teeth at the end of the sound.

43
00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:05.850
There should be a distinct duh
created as you make the sound.

44
00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:11.210
Take a few moments to watch this
animation which will show you

45
00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:14.157
how to make the d sound.

46
00:03:14.157 --> 00:03:22.306
>> [SOUND]

47
00:03:22.306 --> 00:03:27.067
>> Let us try to imitate this sound by

48
00:03:27.067 --> 00:03:33.360
repeating these words: document, dead,

49
00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:39.840
nobody, children, education, decided.

50
00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:45.996
Now repeat the following phrases,
study hard, a difficult decision,

51
00:03:45.996 --> 00:03:52.380
birthday cards, modern methods,

52
00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:56.700
added and subtracted, cold and dark.

53
00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:02.320
Great, let's do a quick recap.

54
00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:05.430
We worked on the th and the duh sounds.

55
00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:12.400
Remember that these sounds are often
commonly confused, but with time and

56
00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:17.020
practice on them your pronunciation and
speaking should improve.

57
00:04:18.710 --> 00:04:22.770
You can also practice other challenging
English sounds throughout this course and

58
00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:23.780
specialization.

59
00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:26.360
Thanks for watching.
