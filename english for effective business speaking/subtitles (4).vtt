Hi, and welcome to this video
on Challenging English sounds.

2
00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:07.180
In this lecture,

3
00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:10.820
we're going to take a look at a pair
of challenging English sounds.

4
00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:14.900
They are /ae/, as in "man",
/e/ as in "men".

5
00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:21.480
These vowel sounds are problematic for
speakers of German, French, and Chinese.

6
00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.510
For example, French speakers may find it
difficult to distinguish the difference

7
00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:29.901
between pat, the /ae/ sound,
and pet, the /e/ sound.

8
00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:36.370
To make the /ae/ sound, keep your tongue
low, slightly open your mouth, and

9
00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:40.730
keep your jaw open like this, /ae/.

10
00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:43.376
Take a few moments to
watch this animation,

11
00:00:43.376 --> 00:00:46.315
which will show you how
to make the /ae/ sound.

12
00:00:48.534 --> 00:00:56.173
>> /ae/, /ae/.

13
00:00:56.173 --> 00:01:01.828
Okay, let's practice the /ae/

14
00:01:01.828 --> 00:01:07.288
sound by repeating these words,

15
00:01:07.288 --> 00:01:12.960
ad, man, than, mat hat, plan.

16
00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:14.750
Now for the /e/ sound.

17
00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:16.104
Do everything the same.

18
00:01:16.104 --> 00:01:19.843
But close your jaw like this.

19
00:01:19.843 --> 00:01:20.343
/e/.

20
00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:26.837
Take a few moments to watch this
animation which will show you how to make

21
00:01:26.837 --> 00:01:28.095
the /e/ sound.

22
00:01:30.661 --> 00:01:31.166
>> /e/.

23
00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:36.281
/e/.

24
00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:43.230
Now, repeat these words, bet, men,

25
00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:47.284
then, met,

26
00:01:47.284 --> 00:01:51.920
bread, pen.

27
00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:54.020
Great, let's do a quick recap.

28
00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:58.950
We worked on the /ae/,
as in "man" sound, /e/, as in "men".

29
00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:03.830
Remember that these sounds are often
commonly confused, but with time and

30
00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:08.400
practice on them, your pronunciation and
speaking should improve.

31
00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:12.190
You can also practice other challenging
English sounds throughout this course and

32
00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:13.080
specialization.

33
00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:15.332
Thanks very much for watching.
