00:00:05.652 --> 00:00:09.368
Let's see,
I would say my major weakness it

2
00:00:09.368 --> 00:00:13.750
that I'm a bit of a perfectionist and
workaholic.

3
00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:18.350
I tend to set overly high standards for
myself and my other colleagues around me.

4
00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:22.020
For example, one project in my
current position, as an IT manager,

5
00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:26.420
we were required to meet a deadline for
the implementation of a new

6
00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:29.180
customer relationship managing
database within a month.

7
00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:32.550
And I made my team work
overtime every night and

8
00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:35.880
the weekend for the whole month
until the deadline was met.

9
00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:41.927
I don't think it was very popular
management at the time, but

10
00:00:41.927 --> 00:00:47.880
I made sure that I gave them some time
off after that particularly tough month.

11
00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:52.750
I'm trying to work to achieve my work
life balance so I've taken up yoga.

12
00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:59.925
For my strengths I would say that my
strength is my analytical ability.

13
00:00:59.925 --> 00:01:03.780
I'm able to identify problems and
create solutions quite effectively and

14
00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:04.580
efficiently.

15
00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.957
At my last job I supervised our
shipment and delivery department.

16
00:01:09.957 --> 00:01:15.183
I analyzed the product delivery times,
and I did find areas we could cluster our

17
00:01:15.183 --> 00:01:20.262
shipments according to our warehouses and
reorganize our delivery system.

18
00:01:20.262 --> 00:01:26.186
This resulted in 20% improvements
in our delivery times.

19
00:01:26.186 --> 00:01:31.050
I think through this experience I
was able to learn the importance

20
00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:33.976
of paying attention to small details.

21
00:01:33.976 --> 00:01:37.563
I'm pretty happy about my achievement.
