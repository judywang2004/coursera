<p>Leonardo Piero da Vinci was an Italian polymath, painter, sculptor, architect, musician, mathematician, engineer, inventor, anatomist, geologist, cartographer, botanist, and writer.</p><p>So you are saying Leonardo is master of none? Good joke! IMO who knows more things about related areas is better than who knows only one part.</p><p>For example a full stack dev will think better than a front or back end dev.

<p>I have to disagree. As someone who was developing in 1984, my feeling is there was just as much to know back then as there is today; it was simply lower level is all.</p><p>These days I would consider a well-rounded developer someone who has (amongst many other criteria) worked with both Javascript and Cx/Java, who has an awareness of the relative strengths and weaknesses of frameworks (Angular vs. Meteor for example).</p><p>Back then it would have been someone who knew how to profile their code and then optimize inner loops in assembly, someone who knew what the A5 register did on a Motorola 68k in MacOS, and how to use it, someone who knew how to XOR instead of a using a buffer update.</p><p>When the items in the stack were fewer and more primative, we had to go deeper, and the information was a lot harder to come by then these days when all you have to do is fire up a web browser.</p><p>No matter what you call it, there has always been a need for programmers that have an end-to-end awareness of their craft, from the business needs through to what shows up on a screen, and everything in-between.</p><p>This type of programmer has always been a rare beast because of the breadth and depth of knowledge required to do a good job. The focus has shifted from machine language to frameworks, but it is no more or less demanding than it ever was.</p>

<p>no it doesn't. your attacking his comment without taking in his point. Which i would say is that a full-stack developer, a specialist in web app development, not a half-assed generalist, can see the entire project from a bird's eye view that just isn't possible for the more narrow specialists on either side or in design etc.  Also, using node and express with angularjs is not as difficult and general as you think.  it's all javascript and it's likely to have a very solid architecture when designed by one who see the forest.  So if the full stack is truly at the same skill level as a front or back end dev, he is certainly better in every way and probably grasps concepts in the project workflow with ease due to the perspective he has, while the others trip over each other often since angular makes no sense to a ruby dev or vice versa.</p>

<p>But a general Physician tends to understand a basic symptom in your body more easily than a specialist. Once you have a more specific symptom then you are better off with an specialist.

Think broadly when you reply.</p>

<p>&gt; Coming from Italy, I can tell you it's not the reality</p><p>How that? I don't see what you can know more than another person. With the exception if you really talked to him.<br>I'm from Italy too, so I can't see any new insight just for being from there!</p><p>&gt;Don't think who has a wider view always takes better decisions</p><p>Maybe not but most of the time yes.</p><p>&gt;they might not have the full picture because of lack of insight in some areas that only specialists have.</p><p>The same can happen for specialists. They might have a lack of insight in the global project.</p><p>I can give you a quick example:</p><p>You need to increase the performance of your website. If dev A only knows about optimization he might make some mistakes that will break some other part of the site, he doesn't even know that part even exists. If dev B has a wider knowledge he might know that doing X might break Y. The probability to make better job is for dev B, at least in my opinion.</p>

<p>I'll give you my view (and I tend to consider myself more full-stack than average, so not bringing any "specialist" bias):</p><p>If you need to optimize a website with 10000 users, your example is true. But on a site at the level of Facebook or Twitter or anything that has decent traffic, you either are a specialist, or you have nothing to add. You could know about all of the trenches, from nginx to the shadow DOM in Chrome, but you will have to specialize if you really want to kick ass.</p><p>So it depends on the situation what kind of guy you need. Go with your guts, not with the rules.</p><p>That's my point. Doing an example with Leonardo is like saying that every product manager can be Steve Jobs. Sorry, but if you think that, you're not on the right path buddy...</p>

<p>The key thing to take away from this is "more things about related areas" which makes you a master at a higher abstract of those combined areas, and therefore more of a philosopher or scientist depending on the nature of how you can apply your knowledge.</p><p>Ask yourself: first what do you know can be done, second do you also know how to go about doing it, third can you demonstrate it, and finally, how deep can you explain what is going on with the underlying areas of this higher level abstraction?<br>It's ok to be a jack of all trades, but unfortunately people that hire are often not as knowledgable as those who accumulate knowledge in surrounding areas of a specific specialty, and seek to filter out candidates who believe to be able to reach some (often nonsensical but other times attainable) criteria.<br>I'm glad you can see where you can specialize. As a front end or back end developer I think those are 2 abstractions worth aspiring towards, and don't deny that there is certainly crossover between the two diciplines. I'd like to see more mentorship opportunities that would help separate would-be-full-stack-developers into one of these two areas as I think it would really show where personal interests lie, and finding others to work with, collaborate with, and generate innovative projects would be a process of seeking your other half instead of a self-proclaimed "know-it-all" who may not even meet the requirements of a recruiter (and thus further skew the expectation of what a "full stack" developer even is).</p>

<p>Da Vinci actually was an inventor having invented tank like structures for the king at that time. he also developed other devices that have been cataloged at various museums. how on earth can you say he was not an inventor?</p><p>I am comfortable working on the back end or the front end and in either roll I am always concerned about issues with the other. when I received my CIW certification 20 + years ago no one asked about front end or back end it was more of a concern of can you do it. and with the resources available you either could or couldn't. now their are many more resources. I don't know them all but I am always willing to learn more about the field I work in. but at what cost to me. If I need to learn .net I will learn .net just as I have learned Perl,PHP, CSS, JavaScript, HTML etc. what gets me like the writer of the article above is why the separation and then the recombination that amounts to full stack developer. the last five years I have been looking for a better job and can't get interviews because I can't find jobs that match my specific criteria its very frustrating and in the mean time I'm stuck in a full stack job that I'm miserable in because hours fluctuate extremely and most of the time the boss wants me to just use the simplest of remedies that doesn't fix anything. I also walked into his operation after it had been poorly constructed by someone else. he also requires modifications to everything when his systems aren't built for the type of mods he requests. so I go into the back end to facilitate the back end capability and then do the front end mod as requested. in fact just last week I modified his store so it now has sup to 6 SKU's  for sales and his 4 primary product don't show the final price until your in the detail page which makes no sense to me because if the search engines pick up the page and publish he will end up in trouble for under cutting other distributors. and if he wants me to no-follow those pages that also needs to be built into the system which is not designed for it. yes it could be done fairly easily but I haven't done the research to confirm it wouldn't break anything in the process and getting information from him takes way to long to begin with. enough run on sentences. great article. Oh and I'm also a licensed state approved automotive inspector. .</p>

<p>Many years ago, I worked with a developer who wrote more or less perfect code. It took him 3 times as long to work on his projects. He was let go. Unless you work on a space shuttle most companies can live with bugs (Microsoft included), but value time. There are always trade-offs and time usually wins (unless you are a big bank with very limited competition). Actually that is something Edward Yourdan also said in his book Byte Wars (WBT in 2001)</p>

<p>"getting it done" and "doing it right", this is a nice comparison but unfortunately does not work separately in most cases.</p><p>in the real world where employers/clients want you to get it done AND do it right.<br>and in many cases, when you don't do it right, you don't get it done also. this rule becomes more true the bigger project is.</p><p>people who constantly learn on the job or treat the job as a learning playground I find are the first ones employers lose patience with.<br>as eblinick stated, there are tradeoffs developers have to make, this is a result of pressures from the employer, not cause the developer wants to NOT do it right.</p><p>if you're hired for a job, come prepared.<br>there are exceptions ofcourse and some companies specializing in software development have a different "culture" and are more open than others to the learning as you go process.<br>I have no problem with this concept of full-stack developer as this simply means I have the capability of developing a fully functional application and have overview of all layers.</p><p>the other problem I find is that many "full-stack" developers move to other frameworks/languages without ever mastering one "stack".<br>while "mastering" can be viewed as "anti-learning" (as the OP seems to view it in the sense that one must move on to learn something else), mastering is what usually gives you the ability to "get it done" AND "do it right".<br>the problem is not so clear, pressures from job market, employers etc...can make or break you as a full-stack developer.</p>

<p>Like others mention here, I don't understand the controversy. By full stack, I mean generalist with multiple fields of competence.</p><p>Along my career, I have been a Unix admin, a database technical lead, worked on infrastructure (what would be called build engineering), devops, reporting, back end/business logic, front end/ui, and even a little bit of UX. If I am hiring for "full stack," I'm usually looking for someone to do good-enough work in enough areas on a small team with a small or medium sized project.</p><p>My tradeoff is that I don't generally work on  the complex projects where specialists shine. It's a tradeoff. I traded breadth for depth early in my career.</p><p>I have no problems with calling myself "full-stack" -- I make no apologies for the compromises that entails, however.</p>

<p>finally! i would call myself more full-stack as well, yet i feel im still a specialist on some level. On most projects, I make rapid prototypes with angular and a css framework based on the data which i keep in a json file, I wire up json data or nosql for larger sets and use node or php to bring it over.  Responsive planning and animation is still where i  put most time.</p>

<p>I think one of the main points being overlooked here is that "full-stack" developers have a significant advantage when it comes to understanding the application from a macro level. They understand how each part of the stack works in regard to the application as a whole.</p><p>While they may not know the intricate details of Java or any other language they understand why and how it is being used. There is one job that will probably pay way more than any "specialized" development job and this the application architect. It is imperative that the architect be knowledgable in all areas but a master in either one or none.</p><p>It is not the architect's job to know the finite details of the implementation of each level of the stack, only to offer guidance on framework choices and application architectural patterns, and keep developers informed and ensure adherence to the technical specifications.</p><p>Without having come from a background where you have experience in each of these levels of the stack you can't accurately make suggestions on the architecture of an application, whether it be desktop software or a web application.</p><p>To say that it is better to specialize in a single area than to amass knowledge and skill in multiple areas just points out who will have better success in a developer role (micro or specialized), and who will do better in an architectural role (macro or "full-stack").</p><p>So with that be happy to be a full-stack developer because it will open many doors for you should ever decide to solve puzzles at the macro level and not the micro level.</p><p>Cheers and happy coding!</p>

<p>"getting it done" and "doing it right", this is a nice comparison but unfortunately does not work separately in most cases.</p><p>in the real world where employers/clients want you to get it done AND do it right.<br>and in many cases, when you don't do it right, you don't get it done also. this rule becomes more true the bigger project is.</p><p>people<br> who constantly learn on the job or treat the job as a learning <br>playground I find are the first ones employers lose patience with.<br>as<br> eblinick stated, there are tradeoffs developers have to make, this is a<br> result of pressures from the employer, not cause the developer wants to<br> NOT do it right.</p><p>if you're hired for a job, come prepared.<br>there<br> are exceptions ofcourse and some companies specializing in software <br>development have a different "culture" and are more open than others to <br>the learning as you go process.<br>I have no problem with this concept <br>of full-stack developer as this simply means I have the capability of <br>developing a fully functional application and have overview of all <br>layers.</p><p>the other problem I find is that many "full-stack" <br>developers move to other frameworks/languages without ever mastering one<br> "stack".<br>while "mastering" can be viewed as "anti-learning" (as the <br>OP seems to view it in the sense that one must move on to learn <br>something else), mastering is what usually gives you the ability to "get<br> it done" AND "do it right".<br>the problem is not so clear, pressures from job market, employers etc...can make or break you as a full-stack developer.</p>

<p>Software engineering best practices are not bound to a technology. Technology best practices are bound to a technology. Once you become a good software engineer you can learn languages and their best practices a lot easier as you understand the problems these languages are trying to solve, and the complexity they are abstracting away for you.</p><p>Once you can clearly understand these things moving around on the stack becomes easier, and in a world where we are moving to developers owning the full life-cycle of a service/product. We will see less and less of a distinction between a full-stack developer and a developer.</p><p>As to a lot of the other stuff you mentioned, I'm not sure how pressure to complete work weighs in to this discussion, or how it can make or break you as a software engineer. Only you can make or break yourself as a full-stack engineer.</p><p>Although I will say that if you are working in a place where research and prototyping to find the best solution is not a common practice then you should move on. There is nothing worse for your future as a developer than a bad working environment.</p><p>Also I am not saying you can call yourself an architect and learn as you go. It requires experience before making architectural decisions.</p><p>I agree that the term full-stack is not a great one, but it is what software engineers who work in different environments are referred to. As we lose the idea of a "stack" (which is happening right now, look at the differences between a monolith architecture and a microservices architecture) we will lose the idea that developers must focus on one language/stack of a system.</p>

<p>my argument is not against full-stack developer/engineer, I'm all for it, I consider myself one, not the greatest in the world, but one who strives atleast for perfection. I have no quarrel with the term itself.</p><p>what I disagree with is this notion in the OP that somehow if you're not learning constantly new technologies and instead obsessed with mastery, it makes you a poor developer overall.</p><p>this is simply not true.</p><p>first, I agree completely with most of your points, software engineering (data structures) is the basis for good development vs. bad development overall, and this universal between "stacks" or architectures etc...<br>everything flows from it.<br>however, it takes time to become properly acquainted of the ins and outs of the systems/architectures <br>you're dealing with and how to properly setup relative to your software <br>engineering.<br>and while data structures is extremely important that is still half the story.<br>the algorithms and utilizing the architecture properly will only then close the loop on the project, especially in web development where so many layers have to be dealt with.</p><p>full-stack developers can then provide good quality work in a reasonable period of time.</p><p>mastery shows that you want to become the best you can be before you move onto something else.</p><p>I do not agree with the implication the OP is making.</p><p>I also find that as a full-stack developer who has provided good quality work I have found it difficult to obtain clients/jobs these days without right social network/connections.</p><p>I've seen many not so great full-stack developers who get all the jobs and highest salaries because they have most the friends/connections to get them in and promote them.<br>This is maybe the OP's experience with these sort of individuals.</p><p>I do not think someone with real full-stack developer would want to continue their line of work with constant failure.</p>
