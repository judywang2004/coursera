00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:06.035
As you begin the journey into this third
course in the specialization dealing

2
00:00:06.035 --> 00:00:11.700
with Front-End JavaScript frameworks,
in particular AngularJS,

3
00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:15.890
let me give you a quick
overview of the entire course.

4
00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:20.160
And then position it in
the context of the specialization.

5
00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:29.010
Going back to our diagram where we looked
at various technologies in the previous

6
00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:34.930
lecture, this particular course is
still dealing with the front end side.

7
00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:40.200
We are looking at front end JavaScript,
Frameworks.

8
00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:46.020
How they make use of the JavaScript on
the front end side in order to deliver

9
00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:51.430
their information to the users, or
random information in a browser.

10
00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:56.002
So, this course dealing with AngularJS,

11
00:00:56.002 --> 00:01:01.971
one of the most popular front
end Java Script frameworks

12
00:01:01.971 --> 00:01:09.979
will give you a in-depth introduction
to various features of AngularJS.

13
00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:14.842
As you go through this
course in addition to

14
00:01:14.842 --> 00:01:20.180
AngularJS We will also
deal with web tools.

15
00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:24.660
We have already seen node and
in the previous course.

16
00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:28.550
In this course, we're gonna look
at task runners, Grunt and Gulp.

17
00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:37.190
And also, scaffolding tools,
Yo and the whole tool bench,

18
00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:42.010
the Yeoman tool bench,
which includes Yo, Grunt and Gulp and

19
00:01:43.701 --> 00:01:49.060
together, to enable your
web development work flow.

20
00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:52.200
This diagram is a big picture overview of

21
00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:56.770
several things that you will encounter
as you go through this course.

22
00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:01.050
This picture may not make as much
sense to you at this moment.

23
00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:06.090
But when complete the course we will come
back to this picture one more time, and

24
00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:13.750
then see how all that we have covered fits
into the big picture view of AngularJS.

25
00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:15.340
So as you go through this course,

26
00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:20.870
we will realize that views which
is what is seen by the end user.

27
00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:26.070
Is rendered in AngularJS as a combination
of templates and controllers.

28
00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:30.090
They require the use of scope.

29
00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:33.630
Templates themselves
are built using directives.

30
00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:36.240
Which we will explore in some detail.

31
00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:41.600
And we might need to do some
data filtering using Filters.

32
00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:47.000
Now the controllers themselves
pull the data in from Factories,

33
00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.690
or Services, or Providers.

34
00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:54.570
These Factory Service or Provider
in turn are the ones that interact

35
00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:58.500
with the back end server in order to
pull in the data into your application.

36
00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:05.480
Your application itself, the Angular
application, is organized as a module or

37
00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:08.710
as a group of cooperating modules.

38
00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:11.490
Each module has a configuration.

39
00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:15.820
And when you have multiple
views how you move

40
00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:20.340
from one view to another in
response to radius events and

41
00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:24.778
user interactions is all controlled by.

42
00:03:24.778 --> 00:03:31.220
So we will examine this entire
picture as we go through this course.

43
00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:34.275
And then I'll come back to this
picture at the end of the course,

44
00:03:34.275 --> 00:03:39.740
then put the entire course
in the right perspective.

45
00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:43.560
Once you complete all these
different pieces that you will see

46
00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:46.800
when you go through this course.

47
00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:52.480
The course itself is
organized into four modules,

48
00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:55.470
each module corresponding
to one week of work.

49
00:03:56.900 --> 00:04:01.910
In the first module we will still
review the Full Stack Web Development.

50
00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:04.150
If you are coming in
from the previous course,

51
00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:06.980
you will already seen me talking
about Full Stack Web Development.

52
00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:14.730
You may just wish to review just
the course overview in this lesson.

53
00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:19.420
After that,
we'll introduce you to AngularJS,

54
00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:26.570
then we'll look at Model View Controller
and model view whatever frame works

55
00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:31.965
that are essential for understanding and
how Angular applications are built.

56
00:04:33.005 --> 00:04:35.465
Then we'll look at Angular Filters, and

57
00:04:35.465 --> 00:04:39.105
that will take you through to
the first assignment in this course.

58
00:04:40.745 --> 00:04:45.950
The second module concentrates
on giving you the skills

59
00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:52.230
of using task runners to automate
your web development tasks.

60
00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:57.190
We'll look at Grunt and
Gulp in a reasonable amount of detail to

61
00:04:57.190 --> 00:05:02.160
help you understand how this
tools are organized, and

62
00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:10.030
how they enable you to manage
your development workflow.

63
00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:13.710
In addition we'll look at Angular Scope,
and

64
00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:19.480
an important concept about Angular
forms and form validation.

65
00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:23.070
Support that is built into Angular, and

66
00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:25.340
that will take you through
to the second assignment.

67
00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:33.180
The third week will concentrate
on Single Page Applications.

68
00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:38.090
Now, Angular can be used without using
it for Single Page Applications.

69
00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:43.500
Single Page Applications are something
that brings angular together and

70
00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:47.560
then brings the entirety
of the angular support

71
00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:57.580
integrated well into delivering
a excellent application to the end user.

72
00:05:57.580 --> 00:06:03.350
So we'll look at how we communicate with
a back end using an Angular Factory or

73
00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:04.540
a Service.

74
00:06:04.540 --> 00:06:07.380
We'll also talk about
Dependency Injection.

75
00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:13.190
We'll look at Angular Templates and
how they play a roll

76
00:06:13.190 --> 00:06:18.530
in defining the views that you use
within your angular repetition.

77
00:06:18.530 --> 00:06:24.270
Then we look at routing, in particular
about Angular's ngRoute module.

78
00:06:25.380 --> 00:06:27.671
For developing single page applications.

79
00:06:27.671 --> 00:06:32.655
We also look at the angular UI-Router
which is another module that

80
00:06:32.655 --> 00:06:36.685
also enables you to build
single page applications.

81
00:06:36.685 --> 00:06:40.510
UI-Router is more flexible of the two.

82
00:06:42.010 --> 00:06:44.870
That'll take you through
to assignment three

83
00:06:44.870 --> 00:06:47.650
where you will complete
a single page application.

84
00:06:50.050 --> 00:06:54.990
Finally, in the last module, we are
dealing with Client-Server Communication.

85
00:06:56.250 --> 00:07:01.150
What kind of support does Angular have for
providing Client-Server Communication?

86
00:07:01.150 --> 00:07:04.230
So we'll give you a quick
overview of networking,

87
00:07:04.230 --> 00:07:08.810
essentials that are necessary for you to
understand Client-Server Communication.

88
00:07:08.810 --> 00:07:13.256
We'll look at the use of
Angular's $Http Service, and

89
00:07:13.256 --> 00:07:19.110
Angular's $resource Module to
enable Client-Server Communication.

90
00:07:19.110 --> 00:07:24.460
We'll briefly touch upon
Angular Testing and then round it off

91
00:07:24.460 --> 00:07:28.775
with a discussion about
scaffolding tunes U.

92
00:07:28.775 --> 00:07:31.660
.And the Yeoman work flow.

93
00:07:33.250 --> 00:07:38.270
That will take you all the way through
to the final assignment in this course.

94
00:07:38.270 --> 00:07:43.950
Now the Angular course lays
a very good foundation for

95
00:07:43.950 --> 00:07:48.590
the next course that is coming up in
this specialization, which is about

96
00:07:50.400 --> 00:07:56.590
mobile application development using HTML,
CSS, and JavaScript.

97
00:07:56.590 --> 00:08:01.770
Where we will look at Cordova and
the Ionic Framework.

98
00:08:03.510 --> 00:08:07.400
I hope you have fun going
through this course.

99
00:08:07.400 --> 00:08:12.510
Again, it is going to be hard work but

100
00:08:12.510 --> 00:08:17.170
it is definitely worth
the work that you put in.

101
00:08:18.470 --> 00:08:23.340
Please take the time to
learn the concepts in depth.

102
00:08:24.370 --> 00:08:29.820
And as always, I am right behind
you to take care of any questions,

103
00:08:29.820 --> 00:08:34.480
comments, and issues that arise
as you go through this course.
