00:00:01.870 --> 00:00:05.850
Hello and welcome to this lecture
on Elements of a Persuasive Speech.

2
00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:07.600
Now by the end of this lecture,

3
00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:13.630
you will be able to use basic
strategies in a persuasive speech.

4
00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:19.140
You'll learn how to appeal to emotion,
logic, and authority in your speech.

5
00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:23.678
And you'll also learn how to
use strategies that appeal, or

6
00:00:23.678 --> 00:00:27.070
sort of use comparisons, degrees,

7
00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:32.100
relationships, circumstances, and
testimonials to support an argument.

8
00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:36.910
And, you'll also learn how to use
inclusive language, such as words like,

9
00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:39.040
us and we.

10
00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:41.420
Okay, so where do we begin?

11
00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:45.386
Well we would begin as usual by
thinking about the purpose and

12
00:00:45.386 --> 00:00:47.630
the audience of your speech.

13
00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:48.700
If you don't know these,

14
00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:53.100
then you'll have a very difficult time
persuading someone to do something.

15
00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:54.290
So purpose, obviously,

16
00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:57.930
you should understand,
what is it that I want my audience to do?

17
00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:01.640
You should define that right off at
the bat, right at the very beginning.

18
00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:05.151
What is it that I want them to do
by the end of this speech, okay?

19
00:01:05.151 --> 00:01:08.490
And then understanding your audience,
obviously,

20
00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:13.870
should allow you to determine what
type of strategy you're going to use

21
00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:18.530
to convince them to do what it
is you want them to do, okay?

22
00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:20.872
So that's the very first thing.

23
00:01:20.872 --> 00:01:23.110
You need to really think about these.

24
00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:26.030
So once you've thought about these things,

25
00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:29.110
you should start to think about things
like, am I going to appeal to logic?

26
00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:33.790
Am I going to appeal to emotion, or
am I going to appeal to authority?

27
00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:37.471
These are three different strategies
that you might want to think about.

28
00:01:37.471 --> 00:01:41.096
Now of course, it becomes very
important that as you do this,

29
00:01:41.096 --> 00:01:43.760
you need to think about
possible fallacies.

30
00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:47.560
For example, if I rely too
much on appealing to emotion,

31
00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:51.330
I might have a lot of problems
with the logic of my argument, and

32
00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:55.530
therefore my argument may
not be very persuasive.

33
00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:59.910
Think about any kind of advertising
that you've seen on TV recently.

34
00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:02.370
Quite often they rely a lot

35
00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:06.060
on emotion to convince you that
the product is a good product.

36
00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:09.760
However, if you start to analyze
the commercial a little bit,

37
00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:13.270
you'll realize that there's not
a lot of logic in their argument.

38
00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:18.080
Quite often,
it's a good idea to use a combination.

39
00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:22.610
You might want to appeal mostly to logic,
but you could bring in emotion and

40
00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:28.180
authority to make your
presentation more persuasive.

41
00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:31.970
So, it's a good idea to
consider using a combination.

42
00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:35.916
And that can then make your argument
a little bit more persuasive,

43
00:02:35.916 --> 00:02:40.283
and you then should just think about
how you might support your argument,

44
00:02:40.283 --> 00:02:44.805
whether through evidence, examples,
data, comparisons, contrasts.

45
00:02:44.805 --> 00:02:47.845
We'll get into a little bit
more about that later, but

46
00:02:47.845 --> 00:02:52.850
that's where you should start thinking
about how you will support the argument.

47
00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:58.940
And then, you want to tell them, well how
will all of this lead up to an action?

48
00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:00.104
What action should you take?

49
00:03:00.104 --> 00:03:01.706
I've convince you that you should do this.

50
00:03:01.706 --> 00:03:05.740
I've shown you why,
now I'd like you to do this, okay.

51
00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:09.890
Let's go back to the audience and purpose
and the things that I mentioned to you.

52
00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:11.304
I talked about appealing to logic.

53
00:03:11.304 --> 00:03:16.520
I talked about appealing to emotion, and
I talked about appealing to authority.

54
00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:20.120
But let me go into a little bit more
detail about what I mean by these

55
00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:20.710
three things.

56
00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:23.800
So let's first look at logic.

57
00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:26.480
What should I consider when
I'm trying to appeal to logic?

58
00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:33.088
Well, obviously you should consider,
do I make sense?

59
00:03:33.088 --> 00:03:37.110
If I'm talking about A, and I'm trying to
get you to move from point A to point B,

60
00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:39.120
is it a logical step?

61
00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:43.051
If this, then that,
is that logical, for example?

62
00:03:43.051 --> 00:03:47.030
So you need to make sure that your
argument has some logical reasoning.

63
00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:49.650
But it's not just that,
you need to be able to support it.

64
00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:52.310
You need to be able to
support it with evidence.

65
00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:57.270
Other support that you might
want to consider is examples or

66
00:03:57.270 --> 00:04:00.217
perhaps data that you might have.

67
00:04:00.217 --> 00:04:04.484
The important thing is you
begin with an argument.

68
00:04:04.484 --> 00:04:08.884
You show the logical connection between
things and how you got to that argument,

69
00:04:08.884 --> 00:04:13.130
and you support that with relevant data
whether it's evidence or examples.

70
00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:15.740
Okay, let's get to emotion.

71
00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:19.020
Now emotion's another common strategy in

72
00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:21.640
trying to persuade
someone to do something.

73
00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:26.830
And usually with emotion, you're trying
to manipulate the audience's emotions.

74
00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:31.340
You're trying to get them to feel
something, happiness or anger or

75
00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:32.688
excitement.

76
00:04:32.688 --> 00:04:36.920
And are you hoping that that will
get them motivated to do something.

77
00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:39.152
And there are different
ways you can do this.

78
00:04:39.152 --> 00:04:41.540
A common way is to tell stories.

79
00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:45.025
You might tell them a story,
a very short story or

80
00:04:45.025 --> 00:04:50.550
depending on the length of your speech,
a long story to get them motivated and

81
00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:55.590
show them the relevance of what
it is that you want them to do.

82
00:04:55.590 --> 00:05:01.102
But you also might want to allude or
draw on their status, right,

83
00:05:01.102 --> 00:05:07.520
show how it will elevate them and
raise their status in something.

84
00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:10.380
Or you might want to
touch on their values and

85
00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:14.750
show that you have a common value
with them or a common belief.

86
00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:19.460
So this is another way of appealing
to emotion in an argument.

87
00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:23.190
And of course sometimes you might
want to use what we call emotive words.

88
00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:28.190
And emotive words are very strong words,
words that carry a lot of emotion.

89
00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:33.150
Quite often they'll be in the form
of adjectives or adverbs, and

90
00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:38.370
they stir, they create a lot
of emotion in your audience.

91
00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:39.682
So, you might rely on this.

92
00:05:39.682 --> 00:05:42.300
Think of a lot of commercials
that you've watched recently.

93
00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:47.528
They'll often rely on strong,
emotive words to convince you that their

94
00:05:47.528 --> 00:05:53.850
product or service matches your values and
your beliefs or your desires.

95
00:05:53.850 --> 00:05:59.830
Okay, the other appeal that I
mentioned was appeal to authority.

96
00:05:59.830 --> 00:06:03.950
Now appeal to authority is where
you show that you have an expert

97
00:06:03.950 --> 00:06:05.747
opinion about something.

98
00:06:05.747 --> 00:06:08.358
And you're trying to impress the audience,
and

99
00:06:08.358 --> 00:06:11.440
you're using this to
support your argument.

100
00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:16.040
And, again, I can talk about commercials.

101
00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:20.201
Sometimes, if you ever watch a commercial,
Colgate, for example,

102
00:06:20.201 --> 00:06:23.740
toothpaste, nine out of ten
dentists recommend Colgate.

103
00:06:23.740 --> 00:06:26.510
Well there it's appealing to authority,
all right?

104
00:06:26.510 --> 00:06:32.730
If I know that nine dentists choose
Colgate, then Colgate must be good.

105
00:06:32.730 --> 00:06:36.710
Of course, as I mentioned before,
you have to be aware of logical fallacies.

106
00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:41.680
Just because nine out of ten dentists
in their commercial recommend Colgate,

107
00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:43.710
doesn't mean that Colgate is good.

108
00:06:43.710 --> 00:06:50.540
So appealing to authority alone might
create a logical fallacy in your argument.

109
00:06:50.540 --> 00:06:54.959
But still, it is a good idea sometimes
to appeal to authority because you

110
00:06:54.959 --> 00:06:56.777
want to show your expertise.

111
00:06:56.777 --> 00:07:01.881
You want to show that you are the expert
and the best person to do what it

112
00:07:01.881 --> 00:07:08.368
is that you want to do, and that's why
sometimes you'll use this as a strategy.

113
00:07:08.368 --> 00:07:12.380
Okay, I want to go back to support and

114
00:07:12.380 --> 00:07:16.170
logical support because sometimes
when you're supporting an argument,

115
00:07:16.170 --> 00:07:21.390
you'll need to rely on certain strategies.

116
00:07:21.390 --> 00:07:26.390
For example, you might want to make
a comparison where you're indicating

117
00:07:26.390 --> 00:07:29.800
the similarities and
differences of a product.

118
00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:33.020
Or maybe you want to talk about
the degree of something and

119
00:07:33.020 --> 00:07:36.010
why one product is better than other.

120
00:07:36.010 --> 00:07:40.350
Or perhaps you want to talk about
the relationship, such as the cause and

121
00:07:40.350 --> 00:07:43.120
effect of investing in a business or

122
00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:47.950
the consequences of failing
to properly brand a product.

123
00:07:47.950 --> 00:07:49.820
And you want to talk
about the circumstances,

124
00:07:49.820 --> 00:07:54.290
such as whether something is possible,
or whether something is impossible.

125
00:07:54.290 --> 00:07:58.130
And finally,
you could also rely on testimonies, so

126
00:07:58.130 --> 00:08:03.290
that could bring up on stories to
support why your decision has worked

127
00:08:03.290 --> 00:08:08.650
in the past in relying on other experts or
other experiences of other people.

128
00:08:08.650 --> 00:08:10.670
All right,
let's actually look at an example now.

129
00:08:11.720 --> 00:08:17.430
In this example, take a moment,
read the example and analyze it.

130
00:08:17.430 --> 00:08:20.970
And think about, well what
approach is this person trying to

131
00:08:22.040 --> 00:08:24.610
use to convince me of their argument?

132
00:08:24.610 --> 00:08:26.370
Are they appealing to authority?

133
00:08:26.370 --> 00:08:32.220
Are they appealing to logic, or
are they appealing to emotion?

134
00:08:45.494 --> 00:08:49.215
Right, so if I analyze this,
I can start to think about,

135
00:08:49.215 --> 00:08:53.750
well the quality of lifespan of
today's smart phone is ridiculous.

136
00:08:53.750 --> 00:08:59.438
Right away, this person is using
a very strong emotive word.

137
00:08:59.438 --> 00:09:02.804
Now I would probably argue that
that might be too strong of a word.

138
00:09:02.804 --> 00:09:07.789
And you might be careful because it has
a very strong negative connotation to it.

139
00:09:07.789 --> 00:09:12.754
But nevertheless, this person's
relying on a emotive word, so

140
00:09:12.754 --> 00:09:15.294
we have appeal to emotion there.

141
00:09:15.294 --> 00:09:19.497
But then they start to appeal
to emotion in a different way,

142
00:09:19.497 --> 00:09:23.120
and that is they're starting
to use an anecdote.

143
00:09:23.120 --> 00:09:26.197
They're using a story to
support their argument.

144
00:09:26.197 --> 00:09:28.350
See, here's my evidence.

145
00:09:28.350 --> 00:09:31.570
Here's a person who has
tried to use the phone and

146
00:09:31.570 --> 00:09:33.600
it stopped working after six months.

147
00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:35.040
There's my evidence.

148
00:09:35.040 --> 00:09:36.640
So it's an anecdotal evidence.

149
00:09:36.640 --> 00:09:42.406
Of course, again, like I said,
you have to be aware of logical fallacies.

150
00:09:42.406 --> 00:09:45.011
An issue when using
anecdotes is sometimes,

151
00:09:45.011 --> 00:09:49.400
just because one person had that
experience doesn't mean the majority.

152
00:09:49.400 --> 00:09:51.510
Can you make that sweeping generalization?

153
00:09:53.140 --> 00:09:56.330
Perhaps, perhaps not,
it really depends on the situation.

154
00:09:56.330 --> 00:10:01.301
In this case,
it could be a one in a million chance.

155
00:10:01.301 --> 00:10:05.660
But then, the person relies on
emotion again using a very short

156
00:10:05.660 --> 00:10:10.101
sentence where they say six months,
all right, six months!,

157
00:10:10.101 --> 00:10:13.710
with an exclamation mark, all right.

158
00:10:13.710 --> 00:10:20.060
Then the person relies on authority,
top experts.

159
00:10:20.060 --> 00:10:24.740
Rigorous, there's an emotive word,
rigorous quality control, okay.

160
00:10:24.740 --> 00:10:28.590
So you can see that this person
is using a combination of

161
00:10:28.590 --> 00:10:33.880
anecdotes appealing to emotions with
emotive words appealing to authority.

162
00:10:33.880 --> 00:10:36.640
But there's not a lot of
substantial evidence that

163
00:10:36.640 --> 00:10:39.630
the xPhone is superior to other phones.

164
00:10:39.630 --> 00:10:44.214
Not yet, we're really relying on emotion,
and we're really

165
00:10:44.214 --> 00:10:49.245
relying on authority to convince
people that our product is better.

166
00:11:13.004 --> 00:11:15.187
Let's look at another example here.

167
00:11:15.187 --> 00:11:23.280
In this example, we are using a lot of
emotive words, like loyal customers.

168
00:11:23.280 --> 00:11:29.340
And also we're relying on things
like families, all right?

169
00:11:29.340 --> 00:11:30.930
Families are coming to our restaurant.

170
00:11:30.930 --> 00:11:34.813
So we're relying on values,
the value of the family.

171
00:11:34.813 --> 00:11:39.246
And we're trying to appeal to
authority a little bit because people

172
00:11:39.246 --> 00:11:43.210
have been coming to our restaurant for
a long time.

173
00:11:43.210 --> 00:11:47.214
Now notice the inclusive language,
and I'll get more to that later.

174
00:11:47.214 --> 00:11:50.230
But using inclusive language, like our,

175
00:11:50.230 --> 00:11:54.510
is quite important, and
we do it later on as well.

176
00:11:54.510 --> 00:12:00.120
But we appeal to authority, quality food,
and a wholesome environment.

177
00:12:00.120 --> 00:12:04.851
Not only is that appealing to authority,
but

178
00:12:04.851 --> 00:12:09.350
it is also appealing to family values.

179
00:12:09.350 --> 00:12:15.198
So, again, here's an argument that we're
using language to be persuasive by

180
00:12:15.198 --> 00:12:20.365
appealing to emotion,
appealing to the audience's family values.

181
00:12:20.365 --> 00:12:22.910
And we're also appealing to authority,

182
00:12:22.910 --> 00:12:26.263
suggesting that our
establishment has quality food.

183
00:12:50.402 --> 00:12:54.131
Now I mentioned the use of
inclusive language, and

184
00:12:54.131 --> 00:12:59.611
that's where you want to consider using
words like we or your or us and you.

185
00:12:59.611 --> 00:13:01.795
You want to take a you
attitude with your audience,

186
00:13:01.795 --> 00:13:05.320
especially if you're trying to
persuade them of doing something.

187
00:13:05.320 --> 00:13:07.560
So words like we, your, your,

188
00:13:07.560 --> 00:13:12.900
and us in these sentences include your
audience in what you're trying to do.

189
00:13:12.900 --> 00:13:15.640
Here's an example of a full sentence, or

190
00:13:15.640 --> 00:13:20.850
two sentences,
that we use inclusive language.

191
00:13:20.850 --> 00:13:23.580
Our company is committed to quality, and

192
00:13:23.580 --> 00:13:26.440
your contributions have
enabled us to grow.

193
00:13:26.440 --> 00:13:31.400
Together, we continue to provide the best
service throughout our Asian community.

194
00:13:32.870 --> 00:13:35.428
Here you can see the words like you.

195
00:13:42.848 --> 00:13:46.635
Now I mentioned the use of
inclusive language, and

196
00:13:46.635 --> 00:13:50.344
that includes using words like we,
your, or us.

197
00:13:50.344 --> 00:13:55.518
And that allows you to create
some sort of environment where

198
00:13:55.518 --> 00:14:00.175
you're including your
audience with your mission or

199
00:14:00.175 --> 00:14:03.392
your action that you want them to do.

200
00:14:03.392 --> 00:14:05.389
No, that's not very good.

201
00:14:09.834 --> 00:14:13.185
Now, I mentioned the use
of inclusive language, and

202
00:14:13.185 --> 00:14:17.330
that includes using words like,
we, your, us, and you.

203
00:14:17.330 --> 00:14:20.480
You want to take a you attitude when
you're trying to persuade someone.

204
00:14:20.480 --> 00:14:23.295
Remember, you're trying to
convince someone of an opinion, or

205
00:14:23.295 --> 00:14:26.090
you're trying to get them
to do some sort of action.

206
00:14:26.090 --> 00:14:31.530
And if you can show how what you're
trying to do is relevant to them,

207
00:14:31.530 --> 00:14:36.580
you might want to use
language that includes them.

208
00:14:36.580 --> 00:14:42.170
So using things that create some sort
of sense of community with you and

209
00:14:42.170 --> 00:14:46.780
your audience or you and your customers,
depending on the context,

210
00:14:46.780 --> 00:14:52.720
that will help make your
persuasive speech more persuasive.

211
00:14:52.720 --> 00:14:54.340
Now, let's look at this example.

212
00:14:54.340 --> 00:14:56.820
Our company is committed to quality, and

213
00:14:56.820 --> 00:14:59.770
your contributions have
enabled us to grow.

214
00:14:59.770 --> 00:15:05.010
Together, we continue to provide the best
service throughout our Asian community.

215
00:15:05.010 --> 00:15:08.628
Notice that we're using words like our and
we,

216
00:15:08.628 --> 00:15:12.801
and this includes the audience
in with your argument.

217
00:15:12.801 --> 00:15:18.978
Okay, so we've talked a lot about
language and appealing to the audience.

218
00:15:18.978 --> 00:15:24.957
Okay, so we've talked a lot about using
basic strategies in a persuasive speech.

219
00:15:24.957 --> 00:15:28.941
And now you should have an idea
of how to appeal to logic and

220
00:15:28.941 --> 00:15:32.350
emotion or
authority to support your argument.

221
00:15:32.350 --> 00:15:34.810
And you should also have an idea that

222
00:15:34.810 --> 00:15:38.060
different ways of supporting your argument
might require you to make comparisons.

223
00:15:38.060 --> 00:15:41.713
It might require you to show contrast and
degrees of differences or

224
00:15:41.713 --> 00:15:44.987
the relationships, or
the circumstances of your action.

225
00:15:44.987 --> 00:15:50.409
Or using testimonials from customers or
experts to support your argument,

226
00:15:50.409 --> 00:15:54.064
and how they can make your
speech more persuasive.

227
00:15:54.064 --> 00:16:00.006
You should also consider how all of this,
a combination of this,

228
00:16:00.006 --> 00:16:05.298
is often the best way to proceed and
not to rely solely on one

229
00:16:05.298 --> 00:16:10.717
strategy like appealing only
to the emotions of audience.

230
00:16:10.717 --> 00:16:12.727
You should probably use a combination.

231
00:16:12.727 --> 00:16:16.820
And you should also consider
using inclusive language.

232
00:16:16.820 --> 00:16:21.771
Take the you attitude,
include your audience in your speech.

233
00:16:21.771 --> 00:16:23.160
You want to engage them.

234
00:16:23.160 --> 00:16:27.410
You want them to think that you're
thinking for their benefit,

235
00:16:27.410 --> 00:16:30.440
especially if you're trying to persuade
them that they should be doing something.

236
00:16:31.830 --> 00:16:32.948
Thank you for watching.
