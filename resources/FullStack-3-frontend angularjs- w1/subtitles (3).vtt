00:00:01.400 --> 00:00:05.850
Welcome to this lecture on rhythm,
stress, and pausing.

2
00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:10.270
Now, by the end of this video,
you will be able to use rhythm,

3
00:00:10.270 --> 00:00:13.770
stress, and pausing to persuade.

4
00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:16.360
English is a very rhythmic language.

5
00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:19.520
How you place stress and
pausing can enhance and

6
00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:22.890
greatly affect your
communication with others.

7
00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:26.637
In the context of speaking persuasively,
placing stress on

8
00:00:26.637 --> 00:00:31.349
the wrong word can make others miss
your main point, or your main argument.

9
00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:36.570
Or worse, they can completely
misunderstand what you're trying to say.

10
00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:41.030
So it is important that you
understand the needs and

11
00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:45.280
the effects of stress and
pausing in your speech.

12
00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:50.830
Let's first look at how stressing works.

13
00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:55.630
In sentences, certain words
receive more stress than others.

14
00:00:55.630 --> 00:01:00.300
We normally stress the main
meaningful words of the sentence,

15
00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.470
which we call content words.

16
00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:07.440
Content words are nouns, verbs,
adjectives, and adverbs.

17
00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:11.450
We do not normally stress less
important words, like pronouns or

18
00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:14.120
prepositions, which we
call function words.

19
00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:17.490
I say normally, because it can happen.

20
00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:21.780
I'm going to speak a very
short sentence for you, and

21
00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:25.780
then ask you to identify
which word is stressed.

22
00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:30.340
To give you some context, let's
pretend I'm shopping for a puppy, and

23
00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:35.240
I want to agree with a friend that
I think a particular puppy is cute.

24
00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.910
Here's the sentence.

25
00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:38.510
She is cute.

26
00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:41.810
I'll repeat it one more time.

27
00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:43.570
She is cute.

28
00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:45.060
Can you hear the word I'm stressing?

29
00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:49.630
Take a look at the three
examples on the screen.

30
00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:52.990
Which sentence shows
the stress word in my example?

31
00:01:56.449 --> 00:01:59.900
The correct answer is the second sentence.

32
00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:03.819
I placed stress on the verb to
show that I agree with my friend.

33
00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:08.730
Remember, changing the stress
on content words and

34
00:02:08.730 --> 00:02:13.140
function words in a sentence
can change the meaning, and

35
00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:16.400
it can also emphasize a main
point that you're trying to make.

36
00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:21.840
Listen to these three examples.

37
00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:25.570
Our product has brought joy to
millions of people in Asia.

38
00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:31.170
Our product has brought joy to
millions of people in Asia.

39
00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:36.560
Our product has brought joy to
millions of people in Asia.

40
00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:44.285
As we just talked about, stress highlights
key words for a listener's attention.

41
00:02:45.535 --> 00:02:52.105
We often pause slightly before a strongly
stressed word to had emphasis or emotion.

42
00:02:53.765 --> 00:02:56.075
Let's take a look at this sentence.

43
00:02:56.075 --> 00:02:59.090
Where do you think
the pausing should occur?

44
00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:00.430
Try reading it out loud.

45
00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:02.810
Here's how I would say the sentence.

46
00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:08.640
Their product is well designed but
it is too expensive.

47
00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:11.785
Did you notice where I paused?

48
00:03:13.215 --> 00:03:16.025
I paused after the word designed.

49
00:03:16.025 --> 00:03:20.915
I did this because I wanted to emphasize
the contrast between the ideas

50
00:03:20.915 --> 00:03:25.435
that I think it is a well designed
product, but it is expensive.

51
00:03:27.835 --> 00:03:31.785
The word but already does this,
but by placing a slight

52
00:03:31.785 --> 00:03:36.610
pause between the two phrases,
I'm placing more emphasis on the contrast.

53
00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:40.090
Here, let me repeat.

54
00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:44.090
Their product is well designed,
but it is too expensive.

55
00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:51.490
To sum up, stressing places of emphasis
on the meaning of the stress word,

56
00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:55.920
while pausing breaks the sentences
into chunks of meaning.

57
00:03:55.920 --> 00:04:02.690
Apart from that, pausing also is used to
strongly stress a word and add emphasis.

58
00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:07.510
Go ahead,
practice using stress and pausing.

59
00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:10.000
Listen to speeches by native speakers.

60
00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.330
TED Talks is an excellent
place to watch videos.

61
00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:17.080
Pay attention to how people
pause in between words, and

62
00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:20.650
also how they also place
stress on certain words.

63
00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:27.470
You'll notice that pausing quite often is
not a grammatical point in the sentence.

64
00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:31.070
What I mean by that is, they don't
pause where there's always a comma or

65
00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:32.220
a full stop.

66
00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:37.430
Sometimes they place pauses in between
certain chunks of meaning in a text.

67
00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:39.440
So watch people.

68
00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:43.520
Pay attention how they use pausing to
draw your attention to certain points.

69
00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:47.240
And also pay attention to how
they stress certain words.

70
00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:50.365
How they make use of that
stress to persuade you,

71
00:04:50.365 --> 00:04:53.815
to make you focus on a main
point that you're trying to say.

72
00:04:55.875 --> 00:04:56.961
Thanks for watching.
