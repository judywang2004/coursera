00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:04.230
Hello and welcome to this
lecture on the elevator pitch.

2
00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:05.490
By the end of this video,

3
00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:10.030
you should be able to deliver
an effective elevator pitch.

4
00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:13.860
And the goal here is to
basically introduce you to

5
00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:19.500
a good outline that you should follow
when you're trying to organize a pitch.

6
00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:22.715
One of the first things, of course,
that you should always do is brainstorm.

7
00:00:22.715 --> 00:00:26.300
You should really think about what
it is that you're trying to do.

8
00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:29.530
Is it an opportunity that you
want to convince somebody about?

9
00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:32.440
Or is it a problem that you
think you have a solution for.

10
00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:34.970
So brainstorm,
think of everything that you can,

11
00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:40.550
all the players that are involved,
the context, the business situation.

12
00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:42.320
Get that out on paper and

13
00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:45.232
that should be able to lead you to
define the problem or the opportunity.

14
00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:53.085
Basically, you want to make sure that
you're as precise as you can be.

15
00:00:53.085 --> 00:00:55.185
Quite often elevator pitches are short.

16
00:00:55.185 --> 00:01:00.140
They can range from 30 seconds up to
2 minutes, maybe a little bit more.

17
00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:02.277
So you don't have a lot of time.

18
00:01:02.277 --> 00:01:06.120
You want to be able to introduce yourself,
identify a problem or

19
00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:09.679
an opportunity,
show them that you have the solution, and

20
00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:13.930
then also convince them that they
should be able to do something.

21
00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:19.170
Whether that's to take some sort of
action or invest in your company.

22
00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:20.800
So, plan.

23
00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:22.350
That's what you need to do.

24
00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:26.111
Once you've identified
the focus of your pitch,

25
00:01:26.111 --> 00:01:30.140
including the possible problems or
opportunities,

26
00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:36.330
you should review how you could describe
or maybe analyze and solve the problems.

27
00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:40.150
Or at least show how
the circumstances of your solution

28
00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:43.540
will benefit the people that
you're trying to persuade.

29
00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:47.640
Now remember, that people involved
in your business situation

30
00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.680
may look at things from
different perspectives.

31
00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:54.780
So should always be aware of what
they may feel, what are their values,

32
00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:59.123
what are their beliefs,
what are they wanting to do, okay?

33
00:01:59.123 --> 00:02:02.815
So once you've done this,
think about how you'll introduce yourself,

34
00:02:02.815 --> 00:02:06.029
think about what you're going to
put in the body of your pitch, and

35
00:02:06.029 --> 00:02:08.380
then think about how
you're going to conclude.

36
00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:10.810
What is it that you want them to do?

37
00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:12.290
Now, that's a very vague outline.

38
00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:15.110
So what I want to do is I
want to go into more detail.

39
00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:18.950
What should a good outline
about elevator pitch look like?

40
00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:22.100
Well, I would argue that
there should be five steps.

41
00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:26.350
The first step is your introduction,
and the next step is background,

42
00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:30.642
followed by identifying a problem,
and then how your company, or

43
00:02:30.642 --> 00:02:36.370
your idea can solve that problem,

44
00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:40.060
and then you should ask your
audience to do something.

45
00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:45.510
So that's your basic steps that you
should follow in any elevator pitch.

46
00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:48.500
Let's go in detail now about each step.

47
00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:51.040
So step one is Introduction.

48
00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:55.950
This is where you introduce yourself and
your company and your position.

49
00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:58.470
You want to be precise and concise here.

50
00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:00.550
You don't want to waste a lot of time.

51
00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:04.170
So this is probably the shortest
part of your pitch.

52
00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:06.450
Get in there, let them know who you are,
who you work for, and

53
00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:07.300
what your position is.

54
00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:12.600
The next two steps are really
all about setting the context.

55
00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:14.300
You don't want to waste
a lot of time here, but

56
00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:16.950
you want to be as precise as you can.

57
00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:18.730
Why is this important?

58
00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:20.710
How is this relevant to your audience?

59
00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:24.460
And how does this lead into
a problem that needs a solution?

60
00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:29.640
Or how does it lead into an opportunity
that your company can address?

61
00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:34.180
So this is all about setting the context,
why is it relevant?

62
00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:37.600
And how does that lead into describing
the problem or opportunity.

63
00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:41.320
Okay, once you've established
the background and

64
00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:45.000
the context of the situation and
you've shown the audience how it's

65
00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:49.350
relevant to them, you present your
argument and you need to support this.

66
00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:53.660
You can support this by appealing
to logic, to emotion, to authority.

67
00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:58.420
You can use different strategies
such as comparisons, contrasts.

68
00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:01.760
You can use evidence,
you can use examples or refer to data.

69
00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:05.080
The important thing is
that you are concise.

70
00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:09.040
You get to your argument,
you show them why your solution or

71
00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:14.330
your opportunity or
your idea is the right one.

72
00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:18.960
And you may have to make sure of that
as you move from point to point,

73
00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:21.500
that you use clear discourse markers.

74
00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:24.260
And what I mean by that
is you use sign posts,

75
00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:28.870
words like okay,
now that you've heard about the situation.

76
00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:30.950
Phrases that connects
your ideas basically.

77
00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:34.190
Finally, you make a call for action.

78
00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:37.190
You let your audience know what
it is that you want them to do.

79
00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:39.859
This should be again very brief and
precise.

80
00:04:39.859 --> 00:04:42.380
You've introduced yourself already.

81
00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:43.670
You've given background and

82
00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:47.060
context to show why the situation
is relevant to the audience.

83
00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:50.760
You've shown how you have
the capability to solve a problem or

84
00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:52.750
take advantage of an opportunity.

85
00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:57.760
Now this is where you ask your audience
to do something, whether it's for

86
00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:03.060
investment in your company or
some sort of partnership agreement.

87
00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:05.110
It really depends on your situation.

88
00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:07.870
But this is where you
have to be very clear.

89
00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:10.240
What is it that you want
your audience to do?

90
00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:13.870
Remind them of why the ideas,
the key ideas and

91
00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:17.260
the key points that you brought up
earlier are important to them, and

92
00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:19.750
tell them what it is that
you would like them to do.

93
00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:22.390
So let's review the five steps again.

94
00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:25.290
You introduce yourself and the company.

95
00:05:25.290 --> 00:05:29.510
You set the context of the situation,
give background so that your

96
00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:34.110
audience understands the relevance of the
content that you're going to talk about.

97
00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:37.392
You identify what the problem is,
or the opportunity.

98
00:05:37.392 --> 00:05:39.804
You show how you can solve that problem,
or

99
00:05:39.804 --> 00:05:43.040
how you can take advantage
of that opportunity.

100
00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:45.780
And then you ask
the audience to do something

101
00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:50.290
by reminding them that their
actions can benefit them and also

102
00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:56.960
their actions can help solve a problem or
take advantage of an opportunity.

103
00:05:56.960 --> 00:05:59.730
So that's basically the outline
of an elevator pitch.

104
00:05:59.730 --> 00:06:01.680
It's very simple, five steps.

105
00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:06.950
You can follow that outline and
plan it for a 30 second elevator pitch.

106
00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:09.030
You can plan it for
a two minute elevator pitch.

107
00:06:09.030 --> 00:06:10.919
It's really up to you and your situation.

108
00:06:10.919 --> 00:06:15.539
The important thing is it needs
to follow a logical process.

109
00:06:15.539 --> 00:06:20.648
It needs to be convincing, you need
to draw on your persuasive skills,

110
00:06:20.648 --> 00:06:25.940
appealing to the audience,
appealing to emotion, appealing to logic.

111
00:06:25.940 --> 00:06:30.570
You need to be able to use support
in your argument, examples, data,

112
00:06:30.570 --> 00:06:32.620
comparisons, contrasts.

113
00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:34.210
Rehearse your pitch,

114
00:06:34.210 --> 00:06:38.420
make sure that you do it a few times
before you actually deliver it.

115
00:06:38.420 --> 00:06:40.730
Record yourself doing it,
that's an excellent way.

116
00:06:42.470 --> 00:06:45.930
By watching yourself deliver a pitch,
can show whether or

117
00:06:45.930 --> 00:06:46.950
not you're being effective.

118
00:06:46.950 --> 00:06:49.080
You might notice something
that you're missing.

119
00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:51.440
You might notice that your
language is too vague or

120
00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:56.340
you might notice that your organization
isn't exactly logical, okay.

121
00:06:56.340 --> 00:06:57.650
So there you have it.

122
00:06:57.650 --> 00:07:01.740
Now you should have an idea on
how to deliver an elevator pitch.

123
00:07:01.740 --> 00:07:03.657
Thank you very much for watching.
